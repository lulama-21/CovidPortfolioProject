# COVID-19 Data Analysis  

This project analyzes COVID-19 data using SQL queries to track case numbers, death rates, infection rates, and vaccinations globally. Key queries include **Total Cases vs Total Deaths**, **Total Cases vs Population**, **Countries with Highest Infection Rate**, and **Total Population vs Vaccinations**, providing insights into COVID-19's impact across different regions.  

The analysis also uses **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** and **views** to optimize data processing. Queries such as **world stats aggregation** and **continent-wise death counts** help summarize global trends, while **rolling vaccination calculations** track progress in immunization efforts.
